/*
*   UserInput.h     
*
*   Usage:  A touch event broker that tracks touch point events and uses time, distance, and number of touch points
*           to determine if an event is a button press, a swipe or a pinch activity.  Data is stored in Touch_Control structure.
*           
*           Button: 1 touch point < BUTTON_TOUCH max travel. It passes on the last X and Y coordinates.
*
*           Gesture: 1 or 2 touch points exceeding BUTTON_TOUCH minimum travel. It passes the distance to the gesture handler
*           Direction is positive or negatiove distance fopr X and Y.
*           
*           Non_Blocking: This is a non-blocking state engine with timer "gesture_timer" set for max press duration. 
*           The event is reset after timer expiration.  When a finger is eventually lifted it can become a valid press
*           or gesture again but with new start points. See Dragging description for exception.
*           
*           Dragging: The starting x,y coordinate are stored and a timer started.  While waiting for a press event to complete
*           the current x, y coordinates are updated to permit feedback for dragging type events such as operating a slider.  
*           The starting coordinates are not reset so the total drag distance can still be determined even though the timer has expired.
*
*           Number of touch points can be up to 5 but the code is only working with 2 here.
