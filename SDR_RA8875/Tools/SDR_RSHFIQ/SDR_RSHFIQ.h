// There is now two versions of the USBSerial class, that are both derived from a common Base class
// The difference is on how large of transfers that it can handle.  This is controlled by
// the device descriptor, where up to now we handled those up to 64 byte USB transfers.
// But there are now new devices that support larger transfer like 512 bytes.  This for example
// includes the Teensy 4.x boards.  For these we need the big buffer version.
